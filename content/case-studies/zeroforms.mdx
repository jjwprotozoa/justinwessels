## Problem
Healthcare providers struggled with fragmented patient data and repetitive intake processes. Patients had to fill out the same forms repeatedly across different providers.

## Solution
- **Single patient profile** that can be shared securely across providers
- **Intake workflows** with conditional logic and validation
- **Provider portal** with audit trails and consent management
- **Integration layer** connecting Notion, Make.com, and custom APIs

## Architecture
- Firebase Auth + Firestore for user management and data storage
- Cloud Functions for secure data processing and webhooks
- React frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind for UI
- Notion API integration for document management

## Outcomes
- Improved patient experience with reduced form redundancy
- Enhanced data accuracy through centralized profiles
- Better compliance with healthcare data regulations

## Lessons
- Healthcare data requires extra security considerations and audit trails.
- User experience is critical when dealing with sensitive personal information.
