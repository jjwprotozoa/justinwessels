## Problem
Subscription providers were inconsistent and payment processors sensitive to "streaming" wording. I needed a compliant, resilient way to manage device activations and billing.

## Solution
- **Activation codes** minted via Cloudflare Workers, validated per device
- **Hybrid billing**: Stripe (intl) + PayFast (ZA) with plan toggles & proration
- **Playback engine**: HLS.js with smart ABR, Chromecast, and error fallbacks
- **Comms**: Discord webhooks for ops alerts; WhatsApp templates for CX

## Architecture
- Edge worker → KV cache for activation & rate-limits  
- Firebase (Auth + Firestore) for users, devices, entitlements  
- Next.js admin + public site, Functions for webhooks  
- Observability: structured logs + webhook audits

## Outcomes
- Fewer billing disputes; smoother onboarding  
- Faster support with activation traces and device history

## Lessons
- Don't fight processors—design compliant wording + flows.
- Keep "source of truth" tiny (entitlements) and make everything else derivable.
