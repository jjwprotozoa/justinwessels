## Problem
Teachers and educational administrators needed a tool to create comprehensive, structured curriculum plans for pre-primary education. Existing solutions were either too rigid or lacked AI assistance.

- **AI plan generation** using local Ollama models for privacy
- **Printable exports** with customizable templates
- **Resource database** for educational materials and activities

## Architecture
- Next.js with TypeScript for the frontend and API routes
- Prisma with SQLite for data modeling and persistence
- Ollama integration for local AI model inference
- shadcn/ui components for consistent design system

## Outcomes
- Reduced curriculum planning time by 70%
- Improved consistency across educational programs
- Enhanced teacher productivity with AI assistance

## Lessons
- Local AI models provide privacy benefits for educational data.
- Structured data models are crucial for complex educational planning.
